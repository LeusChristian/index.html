    <td>Chihuahuas are excellent companion dogs. They like attention and are loyal to their owners. Even though they are considered lap dogs, they are active and like to be kept occupied.Chihuahuas are good family pets when treated respectfully, but they have a reputation for snapping at strangers or small children who may be threatening to their diminutive size.Like many small dogs, they may be more prone to barking than some larger dogs. They can also seek to dominate their owners and be somewhat temperamental.</td></a>

    <td><u>German Shepherds</u></td></a>
    <td>the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.</a></td>

  	<td>Originally used by shepherds in the Netherlands for all-around farm work, the Dutch Shepherd is an intelligent, highly trainable jack-of-all-trades. In modern times, they find jobs as police dogs, service animals, and family-friendly companions.You may take a look at the Dutch Shepherd and notice a striking resemblance to German Shepherds or Belgian Shepherds. Thatâ€™s because these cousin breeds share a close ancestry and only diverged a little over a hundred years ago. While Dutch Shepherds are more rare than many other shepherd breeds, they are known to be some of the healthiest and easiest to train.</td></a>
